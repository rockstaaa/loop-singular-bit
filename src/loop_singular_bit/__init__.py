"""
Loop Singular Bit - Extreme Model Compression
============================================

A breakthrough compression system that achieves extreme model compression through 
outlier-preserving 1-bit quantization, enabling large language models to run on 
consumer hardware with minimal quality loss.

Key Features:
- 1.75× to 6.96× compression with <1% quality loss
- Outlier-preserving 1-bit quantization
- Memory-efficient streaming
- Real-time quality monitoring
